src/		Test library source code (for testing C++ classes)
    Makefile		compile unit test library
    utLib1.cpp		library code
    utLib1.h		user interface, #define
obj/		Object .o compiled from src/
lib/		Test library
    TestLib2.pm		for testing programs (perl framework)

netpbm -> ../netpbm	Netpbm library installation

t_*/		Generic test suite contents
    Makefile		run/compile the test
    ref/		reference input/output of the test
    test.cpp		test program (C++)

    tmp/		where the test program is executed, removed each time


Test suites:  (2022-01-19)
------------
?       = not committed
  b     = uses bin/
   l    = uses lib/
     s  = uses src/
 u      = Unit test (C++)        utLib1.cpp
 p      = Program test (command) TestLib2.pm
------  --------------
 u   s  t_gmBox/	gmBox		Grayscale Image Bounding Box class
 u   s  t_gmGeoSpec/	gmGeoSpec	Geometry WxH+X+Y specification class
 u   s  t_gmNetpgm/	gmNetpgm	Netpbm Grayscale input/output class
 u   s  t_gmStats/	gmStats		Grayscale Image Statistics class
 pbl    t_pgm_box/	Bounding box of an elliptical image
 pbl    t_pgm_stats/	Image statistics program
 pbl    t_pgm_swatch/	Extract a swatch of pixels into a table
 pbl    t_pgm_width/	Find width (FWHM) of a spot (circular) image


Test Setup:
-----------
    The individual test  t_*/Makefile  has dependency on the test framework,
    but will not rebuild the test framework.

    Build the test framework in src/ (only needed when it changes):
    % cd  src/
    % make

    Tests do NOT rebuild the object being tested.

    Symlinks:  Intended to allow the whole test suit to be pointed at any
    version of the commands/libraray to be tested.  May not be perfect, i.e.
    not really exercised.
    In bin/ symlinks point to commands being tested.

    Framework was copied from the 'rgpio' project.

Run Tests:
----------
    # Run all tests from this directory
    % make test

    # Run a specific test
    % cd t_<dir>/
    % make test

Git:
----
    The .gitignore file has entries to ignore the transient files in each
    test directory:
    t_*/test.exe
    t_*/tmp
