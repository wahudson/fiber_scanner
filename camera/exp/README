		-------------------------------------

Write-up experiments here.

Experiment directory names incorporate the date first, since that is most
meaningful.  New experiments might add to a directory, but more likely to
start a new one and refer to the old one.

Raw data in:  ../data/
Large raw data is separate, not committed in Git.
