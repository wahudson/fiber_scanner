## Operation Guide
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

    This instrument is a transconductance amplifier, providing a current output
    proportional to a voltage input.  It is also called a Current Source or
    a Current Buffer.

    We are familiar with voltage source devices, commonly as power supplies
    or batteries.
    A current source is different, needing a little more thought for
    safe operation.  Think about a DC current source:

    An ideal current source delivers as much voltage as necessary to cause
    the specified current to flow in the load.
    + When no load is connected, it will drive an arbitrarily high voltage,
	which could be hazardous or damaging to the load.
    + Shorting the output, i.e. connecting a zero ohm load, is perfectly fine
	and the current source delivers the specified current at zero volts.

    Thus special care and sequencing is required when operating a current
    source.
    In particular, this instrument has an "Output Run/Shunt" switch to
    provide a safe path for the current to flow whenever the load is
    being connected, or you just want to turn OFF the load.

    A real current source has a "compliance voltage", the maximum voltage
    that it can deliver across the load.  When the compliance voltage
    is reached, the output current will be less than specified.  When this
    occurs, the op-amp output voltage is clipped, limited by the
    power supply voltage.  Generally it is not good to operate in this
    condition.

Transfer function:

    Io = (1 / Rs) * Vin		output current

	Rs  = 1.0 ohm  internal sense resistor
	Vin = input voltage

    Io = (1.0 mA/mV) * Vin	output current

    Accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the Rs sense resistor, which
    is 5%.

    In addition there is an input offset voltage (from the op-amps) that
    contributes a corresponding output offset current.

Output operation:

    Typically the output of a current source should not be left open-circuit,
    as the output will go to the supply rails and will toggle if the input
    is alternating around zero volts.

    Whenever the output terminals are unconnected, set the "Output" switch
    to "Shunt", which provides a zero ohm load.
    In addition, to reduce op-amp power, set the input to zero volts (or
    disconnect it) or set the "Enable" switch to "Off".

Thermal shutdown:

    The OPA548 power op-amp output will shutdown when the die temperature
    reaches approximately 160 degC, resetting when the die has cooled
    to 140 degC.

    The internal protection circuitry of the OPA548 was designed to protect
    against overload conditions.  Continuously running into thermal shutdown
    will degrade reliability.

    When in thermal shutdown, the "Shutdown" LED will be illuminated, even
    when the "Enable" switch is in the "Run" position.

    If thermal shutdown occurs, set the input voltage to zero (i.e. Io = 0 mA)
    or set the "Enable" switch to "Off".  Setting only the "Output" switch
    to "Shunt" does not reduce the op-amp power.
    Check heatsink temperature and find the cause of over temperature.

    Note that the "Enable" switch in the "Off" position will illuminate the
    "Shutdown" LED regardless of the op-amp thermal shutdown state.

    The worst case thermal load on the OPA548 op-amp is a zero ohm load at
    maximum current (see Limitations below).
    Thus when an output is not needed, it is best to set the input voltage
    to zero (i.e. Io = 0 mA).

Safe (valid) operating region:

    For any load resistance Rd, the allowed output current Io is constrained
    by the available compliance voltage.

	Vd = Io * Rd		voltage across the load

	Io = Vd / Rd		current thru the load

	    |Vd| <= 5.0 V	compliance voltage requirement

	|Io_max| = 5.0 V / Rd	maximum current, positive or negative

    The current limit also constrains:  |Io_max| <= 1.0 A

	Rd (ohm)     |Io_max| (A)
	--------     ------------
	  0		1.0	<
	  1		1.0	<
	  2		1.0	<
	  5		1.0	< Current Limit
	  8		0.625
	 10		0.50
	 20		0.25
	 50		0.10
	100		0.050
	200		0.025
	500		0.010

Output protection:  Inductive Loads

    When the current is changed in an inductive load, a back-EMF
    (electromotive force) is generated.  This generated voltage can be
    damaging to the power op-amp if it forces the output beyond the power
    supply rails.  To avoid this, Schottky diodes shunt this voltage (charge)
    onto the power supply rails.  Typically the power supplies cannot sink
    current (i.e. on the positive supply) so the power supply voltage will
    also rise to the extent the charge is absorbed by the bypass capacitors.
    This protects the op-amp, but may damage the power supplies.

    In general, use caution when applying a large inductive load.

Recommended operation sequence:

    There are many ways to achieve any particular operation, so a strict
    cookbook approach does not really work.  Instead we present some simple
    sub-operation snippets.  Modify to suit the needs of your load.
    The instrument will not be damaged regardless of operation sequence.

    Load considerations:
	Considering the effective resistance Rd of the load:
	    Will the load be damaged by 9.0 V across it?
	    Will the load be damaged by 1.0 A thru it?
	    What power dissipation can the load handle?
	    How do transients affect the load?  (e.g. a speaker)
	Will the input voltage need to be carefully controlled to avoid damage?

	Consider lowering the internal current limit by changing the value of
	resistor Rlim.  [Requires opening the instrument case and replacing
	the Header socket and resistor.]

    Programmed current:
	The programmed current (i.e. Vin) should always be managed to avoid
	exceeding the specified compliance voltage.  Require:
	    Vd <= Vcv

	    Vcv = 5.0 V		max compliance voltage
	    Vd  = Rd * Io	voltage across the load
		Rd = effective load resistance
		Io = programmed output current

    Power ON/OFF:
	Set the "Enable" switch to "Off" before turning on power.
	Not strictly required, but this allows the power supplies to settle
	before beginning operation.

    Connecting the input:
	This can be done anytime, even while load is energized.
	When the input is disconnected, the R1 pull-down resistor will
	set the input to Vin = 0.0 mV, and corresponding 0.0 mA output current.

    Connecting load:
	Set input voltage to zero volts.
	Set "Output" switch to "Shunt".
	Connect the load.
	Set "Output" switch to "Run".

	Controlling the input voltage gives the smoothest transition.
	If transients are tolerated, using only the "Output" switch is
	sufficient.

    Energizing the load:
	Set "Output" switch to "Run".
	Set "Enable" switch to "Run".
	These can be done in either order.

	To minimize transients, set the input voltage to zero first
	(i.e. Io = 0 mA), enable outputs, and then ramp the input voltage to
	desired operation.

Limitations:

    Power supplies are +-9.0 V at 2.1 A DC.
    Thus expect the maximum output voltage could be this voltage.
    Limit total output current accordingly.

    The OPA548 op-amp is rated for 3.0 A continuous output current.

    The heat sink can handle 9 W power at a 35 K temperature rise.
    This is sufficient for worst case 1.0 A output current.

    The heatsink datasheet shows a graph of nominal temperature rise vs
    power, for natural convection:
	  Power (W)  Trise (K)
	     3         13
	     6         25
	     9         35
	    12         45
	    15         54
	    18         63

    Worst case power dissipation in the op-amp is a zero ohm load at maximum
    current:

	P = Io * (VPP - (Io * Rs))		op-amp power

	    VPP = 9.0 V		power supply voltage
	    Rs  = 1.0 ohm	series sense resistor

	Io = 1.0 A,  P =  8.0 W,  Trise ~= 35 K
	Io = 2.0 A,  P = 14.0 W,  Trise ~= 55 K

    In general a 50 degree C rise is acceptable and should be met under
    all load conditions in this design.

Distortion:
    At higher frequencies (e.g. 10 kHz) a spurious transient step has
    been observed in the negative half of a sinusoid waveform.  The
    transient seems negligible at lower frequencies (e.g 100 Hz).
    Cause is unknown, and has not been characterized.

Extended operation:
    A single channel could be operated to +-2.0 A full scale output,
    with the other channel set to Vin= 0 V (i.e. Io = 0 mA).
    The heatsink temperature rise should be around 55 deg C, but check
    for any over temperature condition.
    See Limitations above.
