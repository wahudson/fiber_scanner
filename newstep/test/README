		NewStep Commands -- Testing
		---------------------------

Self-checking regression tests.

Files:  (2025-01-01)
------
Makefile	run all test suites
README		this file

.gitignore	Git ignore transient files

bin/		commands to be tested
    nscc     -> ../../bin/nscc

lib/		Test library
    TestLib2.pm		for testing programs (perl framework)

t_*/		Generic test suite contents
    Makefile		run/compile the test
    ref/		reference input/output of the test
    test.pl		test program (perl)
    tmp/		where the test program is executed, removed each time


Test suites:  (2025-01-01)
------------
?       = not committed
  b     = uses bin/
   l    = uses lib/
     s  = uses src/
 u      = Unit test (C++)        utLib1.cpp
 p      = Program test (command) TestLib2.pm
------  --------------
 pbl    t_nscc/		NSC200 literal Command/Query


Test Setup:
-----------
    The individual test  t_*/Makefile  has dependency on the test framework,
    but will not rebuild the test framework.

    Build the test framework in src/ (only needed when it changes):
    % cd  src/
    % make

    Tests do NOT rebuild the object being tested.

    Symlinks:  Intended to allow the whole test suit to be pointed at any
    version of the commands/libraray to be tested.  May not be perfect, i.e.
    not really exercised.
    In bin/ symlinks point to commands being tested.

    Framework was copied from the 'rgpio' project.

Run Tests:
----------
    # Run all tests from this directory
    % make test

    # Run a specific test
    % cd t_<dir>/
    % make test

Git:
----
    The .gitignore file has entries to ignore the transient files in each
    test directory:
    t_*/test.exe
    t_*/tmp
