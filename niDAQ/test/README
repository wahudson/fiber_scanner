		fiber_scanner/niDAQ -- Testing
		------------------------------

Self-checking regression tests.

Files:  (2024-08-10)
------
Makefile	run all test suites
README		this file

.gitignore	Git ignore transient files

bin/		commands for Test
    numbin -> ../../src/numbin

lib/		Test library
    TestLib2.pm		Library for testing programs (perl).

obj/		compiled .o from src/
src/		test library source code

t_*/		Generic test suite contents
    Makefile		run/compile the test
    ref/		reference input/output of the test
    test.cpp		test program (C++)
    test.exe		compiled test (may be removed)
    test.pl		test program (perl)
    tmp/		where the test program is executed, removed each time


Test suites:  (2024-08-10)
------------
?       = not committed
  b     = uses bin/
   l    = uses lib/
     s  = uses src/
 u      = Unit test (C++)        utLib1.cpp
 m      = Module test (perl)     TestLib2.pm
 p      = Program test (command)
------  --------------
 pbl    t_numbin/	numbin		Linearize scan data with a bin map


Test Setup:
-----------
    The individual test  t_*/Makefile  has dependency on the test framework,
    but will not rebuild the test framework.

    Build the test framework and helper tools:
    % cd  src/
    % make

    Tests do NOT rebuild the object being tested (or the framework).
    This way the object under test does not change due to testing.

Run Tests:
----------
    # Run all tests from this directory.  Also build test framework.
    % make test

    # Run a specific test
    % cd t_<dir>/
    % make test

    Pass if output numbered lines show "OK", fail if "NOT OK".

Strategy:
---------
    Program testing - test.pl
    The idea is to stimulate the program under test with options and input,
    capture the output, and compare against known good output.

    Makefile is the common interface to all test suits, regardless of the
    kind of test.

Git:
----
    The .gitignore file has entries to ignore the transient files in each
    test directory:
    t_*/test.exe
    t_*/tmp

Issues:
