		Piezo Scanner - with Cameron (on 2023-10-12)
		----------------------------

Running piezo scanner with Alex and Cameron.  See Red notebook.

These are Cameron's scripts that she got running to take an image,
modified from her earlier version.
I did not collect any data, just the scripts for reference.

Note niDAQ channels changed, screw is failing on one channel.
