		Raster Scan Methods
		-------------------

Primary principle:
    Exciter mounted on end of a hinged beam moves in Y-axis.
    Another exciter pivots the beam in the X-axis.
    Voice coil exciters provide displacement drive.

    Beam length is long (100 mm) compared to X-displacement (2 mm), making
    a fairly flat object plane.

Variations on Y-axis:  (exciter on end of hinged beam)

    A) Resonant displacement of a fiber cantilever.
	Good for high frequency resonant scan.
	DC displacement possible, but no resonant amplification.
	Curved (cantilever radius) cylinder object plane in Y.
	Flat (large cylinder) object plane in X.

    B) Direct displacement of fiber tip, no cantilever.
	Good for DC positioning fiber tip anywhere in field of view.
	Cannot do high frequency scan.
	Might achieve 30 Hz, limited by force of acceleration.
	Flat object plane in Y.
	Flat (large cylinder) object plane in X.

Low-speed Scan system:  (2022-03-03)

    Use as an initial demonstration system.
    Simplify electronics and RPi interface.
    Direct drive scanner, perhaps at 10 Hz or less.
    Think like an AFM scan (minutes per frame).
    Image scan, needs less photodiode bandwidth (i.e. 5 kHz).
    Planar fiber tip motion, constant NA getting light into the fiber.
