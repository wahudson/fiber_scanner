		Piezo Tube Mount - Design
		-------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Concept
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disc Mount on Lens Tube:

    Piezo Tube is glued end-wise onto the flat surface of a disc, which is
    threaded into a 1 inch diameter lens tube.
    The disc has an axial hole for the optical fiber to go thru, and thru
    the piezo tube.
    Electrical contact to the piezo tube electrodes is made with conductive
    paint (glue) between the electrodes and lead wires.

## Electrical Lead Wire attach to Piezo Tube
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Use conductive glue to bridge gap between piezo tube electrode and the
    electrical lead/terminal.
    The conductive glue is placed at the very base of the piezo tube where
    it is attached to the mounting disc.

    Two methods.

A)  Lead wire, stranded 26 AWG.

    Wire is routed thru a hole in the disc parallel to the tube axis.
    The bare strands are bent 90 degrees and laid flat along the surface
    of the disc and along the arc of an electrode.
    Conductive Paint then bridges the small gap between piezo tube electrode
    and wire.

B)  Header pin, 0.025 inch (0.64 mm) square.

    A common header pin is mounted thru a hole in the disc parallel to the
    tube axis.
    Conductive Paint then bridges the gap between piezo tube electrode and
    header pin.

    The header pin could be bent 90 degrees onto the surface of the disc
    and curved along the piezo tube electrode.

    A solid 26 AWG wire could be soldered on the header pin, and curved
    along the electrode.

    A copper foil could extend the header pin toward the electrode.  But
    this is exactly what the conductive glue is for - typically used to
    repair PC board traces.

    The bent header pin can be clamped in place with #4 sheet metal screw
    overlapping the bent portion.

    Glue header pin in place.  Will it hold well enough?  Probably.


Comparison of features:
    A) Lead wire
	 + Leads come directly off the mount.
	 + Pigtail leads are often handy.
	 + Wire is easier to curve along the electrode.
	 - Want pin connector on end of lead wire.
	-- Need lead wire strain relief.  Seems harder.
	 + Only need pull strain relief, no stress from pushing wire.
	++ A 4-pin connector can mate all 4 leads at once.
	 + Easier to get wire close to electrode.

    B) Header pin
	++ Leads are removeable, not permanently attached.
	 + Connection is made directly on the mounting disc.
	 - Pin could come loose from stress of mating connector to it.
	 - Need Pin strain relief - glued or screwed.
	 - Need push/pull strain relief.
	-- Single-pin connectors (cannot get 4 header pins together). 
	 - Harder to get pin close to electrode.

    I like removable leads, makes device much easier to handle.
    I like multi-pin connector, saves time making connection.
    A short conductive glue path is mute with Silver glue (0.01 ohm/square).
    Both methods seem pretty good.
    I favor (A) Lead wire now 2019-08-05.


Wire strain relief:
    A) Glue wire insulation in hole.
	- Glue may not hold very well on silicon insulation.
	+ Long enough hole may give sufficient friction.

 >  B) Tie knot in wire.  A nice stop-knot.
	+ Simple.  Low frequency, inductance is not a concern.

    C) Screw clamp on wire.  Clamp agaist disc.  Screw need not be insulated.

 >  D) Wrap wire around screw.  Bare or insulated wire.
	+ Simple.  Gives good clamping action.

    E) Solder wire to post.  OR foil.
	- Soldering defeats benefits of stranded wire in conductive glue.

    F) Tapered wedge on wire in hole.

## Electrical Connectors
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lead wire connectors.
    The circular connector and cable of the Piezo_AC_Driver unit is too
    heavy and stiff.  Need something to interface with it.

    Want a small, light connector for the lead wires or header pins comming
    off the Piezo Tube mount.
